# Turtle-Crosser
Turtle crossing game made in Python with GUI implemented via turtle graphics library
This game includes 5 levels with a varying scenary and increasing difficulty level as you go further. A totally original idea originated after performing similar projects on the course (100 days of python code by Angela Yu)

Running the project:
Simply open all files as .py files on a suitable compiler/interpreter and place them in the same project to allow importing of files/modules between the project. When all files are uploaded, run the project.
Hope you enjoy the game!
